## Security Standards


At the same time as there are multiple architecture frameworks, there are also a number of different security frameworks, standards, and regulations that, while not often containing architectural elements in and of themselves, are nevertheless important for the architect to
understand. These include the following:

### Security standards:

Formal standards that govern elements either of security for an entire program or organization or for specific elements of a larger program
(for example, risk management, technical standards). Examples include:
- ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Program Management), 
- KMIP for cryptographic key management, 
- TLS/IPsec for transport layer security, 
- the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, and numerous others.


### Security management frameworks:

Documents that, while not official standards, nevertheless provide guidance about how to implement and manage security within an organization. 
Examples include: 
- [NIST Cybersecurity Framework(CSF)]()
- [HITRUST,](https://hitrustalliance.net/product-tool/hitrust-csf/) 
- [COBIT,](https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit)
- and the [CIS Controls]()


### Regulatory requirements:

Governing legislation that contains elements applicable to information security. Examples include national laws" such as 
- HIPAA in the United States, 
- the Cyber Security Law of the People's Republic of China, 
- and local or regional laws such as US state breach notification laws.
