## What is Secure Software Architecture?

## What is Security By Design?
**Security by design** focuses on preventing a cybersecurity breach rather than repairing the issue and restoring systems after a company has been hit by a cybersecurity breach. 

Also known as *secure by design*, security by design means that companies think about cybersecurity at the beginning of a project. Secure by design means that **software engineers have designed the software to be secure from the outset so as to reduce the likelihood of flaws that might compromise a companyâ€™s information security.**
